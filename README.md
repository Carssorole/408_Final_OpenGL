# 408_Final_OpenGL
An OpenGL program, written in c, using GLFW and GLEW, and simple library linking.  Start of a proof of concept for an x86 powered OpenGL engine.

# Project Summary
An OpenGL program that can open a window and context using GLFW and GLEW in c.  A clean codespace that is organized and functional.  Implement Shaders and vertex groups to make shapes appear on screan in the window.  Set up a code platform for OpenGL applications to be written on top of.

## limitations
This project does not DO much.  As well, it is limited to only Linux systems.  This program requires the libraries needed to be installed, and linked properly.  The project as well, is limited by my limited knowledge of OpenGL.

## Use
This project is the START of bigger things.  It is a cement foundation to a slew of applications.  It is a proof of concept, as to the use of OpenGL with low-level languages, and I plan to go lower.  As well, the OpenGL Simple Start package was born from this project, and that proves to be useful.  It will continue to be useful, for students later.
